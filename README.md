# Intrusion-Detection-System

- Intrusion Detection System is a software or a device that can monitor all the suspicious activities in the network or that activities that violates its policy. IDS is very popular system to protect the networks from different types of attacks.
- Any intrusion activity or violation is reported or informed either to administrator or this information can be centrally collected in a system called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). It collects and combine information from different sources and it uses alarm filtering techniques.

## Types of Intrusion Detection Systems

- There are two most common types of IDS. (NIDS) Network based Intrusion detection system and (HIDS) Host based Intrusion detection system. HIDS is used for monitoring important operating system files and NIDS are used to analyze incoming network traffic.

## Working

- Hereâ€™s how IDS work, IDS when placed at a strategic point or points within a network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network, an IDS will perform an analysis of passing traffic, and match the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behaviour is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator.

## Applications

- Modern networked business environments require a high level of security to ensure safe and trusted communication of information between various organizations.
- An intrusion detection system acts as an adaptable safeguard technology for system security after traditional technologies fail.
- Cyber-attacks will only become more sophisticated, so it is important that protection technologies adapt along with their threats.
